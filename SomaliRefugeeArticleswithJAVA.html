					The policy by President Trump to suspend the US asylum program is affecting Somali refugees in the Dadaab camp in Kenya. According to the UN, 26000 refugees in Kenya were in the process of resettlement of which 14,500 were from Dadaab. This included a 25 year old, Ahmed Ismail Shafat who was born in Dadaab and went through a ten-year vetting process for the US. As the future of the Dadaab, the world’s largest refugee camp is uncertain, this is a worry for Somali refugees trying to get to the US.

					The Dadaab refugee camp was established in 1991 as a temporary camp for Somali refugees who were escaping its civil wa. Since then it has become the largest refugee camp. It is home to half a million occupants, of which 400,000 are of Somali refugees. The life in Dadaab is challenging for refugees who face a host of challenges. It is one of the many “temporary but permanent cities”. This article discusses the plight of life in Dadaab and how refugees live.

					According to Doctors Without Borders, in 2015, Kenyan officials were pushing for the forceful return of Somali refugees in the Dadaab camp in Kenya. MSF believes that despite the poor conditions at Dadaad, it is still better than the life that these refugees would have in Somalia. They stated the need for the Kenyan government and international community to provide stronger protections for these refugees.

					As refugees from Somalia arrived in Dadaab, many of them were to frail and hungry to survive. In other situations many did not even survive the journey to these camps. This was in the face of the droughts that hit East Africa in 2011. There were estimates that a quarter of the Somali population is uprooted. This article highlights the impact this was having on children who were fleeing Somalia as refugees.
